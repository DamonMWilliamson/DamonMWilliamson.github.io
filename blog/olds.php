        <h1>Why I still use old tech</h1>
        <h4><strong>Date: 31-8-2024</strong></h4>
        <P>i still use old old tech such as my beautiful dell latitude e7240, or my amazing galaxy s9+(not the note 9 though i got it free so i cant complain), Or my iPod clasic 6th gen, or eaven my sharp electronic organiser ZQ-520. These are all the dievices i keep on me evrey day (excluding m headphones (kz iems, jbl wireless over ear headphones, and my airpod 2nd generations) all of which are at least 6 to twenty somthing years old.</P>
        <P>But why do you use these? you may be asking, well i could get them for quite cheep. But also I refuse to use anything newer then these because currently companies are trying to make more money which results in them spending less on things which leads to products getting worse. here is a link with more information:</P>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification">wikipedia | Enshittification</a>
        <p>I purchased a 2020 m1 macbook air which cost over a thousand australian dolars with only 256gb of storage and 8gb of ram, because for whatever reason my school requires us to buy these horrible laptops, this laptop has the worst keyboard i ever have used and that is saying somthing i have used cheep late 90s membrane keyboards and the incredibally cheep hp stream, also it has no window snapping, the full screen makes it difficult to multitask, the menubar and dock alongside titlebars take ap a sizable portion of the screen, it has trouble mounting removable drives, it does not allow for legacy software to run, it is hardly customizable, it only has 2 usb 4.0 ports and a headphone jack, the screen is so weak that it broke with a watch being dropped on it, the mac os file system is much too hard to use, and it can not run a linux distro easily. </p>
        <p>this is completely unacceptable for somthing at this price. my dell latitude E7240 i got for around 150AUD and it has the best keybaord i have used on a laptop, runs windows just fine, came with 8gb or ram and a 256gb ssd, but has upgradable ram and storage and a spare mpcie slot so you could add a second wifi card or a cellular card or even a second ssd. you can easily run a linux distro such as fedora which i enjoyed, it is increddibly easy to dissasemble and repair, i have dropped this several times and it is just fine, the battery is removable and replacable, it has 3 usb ports, hdmi, ethanet, mini display port, its charging port, a headphone jack, an sd card reader and dells e-port (which allows for you to connect it to a port replicator exposing acess to many more ports from paralell to display port to msata), it also has a hardware antenna toggle, a small 720p 12"tn panel(which is inferia to the retna display on the macbook but is upgradable to a 1080p touch pannel). This laptop allows for me to do evreything i need to do on a laptop amazingly as i only need to edit emails, word DOCXs, powerpoints, browse the web, edit photos, program, and play the occasional SNES game. </p>
        <p>The smae thing goes for my phone, i use the galaxy s9+ which has usb c, and the all important headphone jack. it has 256gb of storage and 6 gb of ram. I find this is pleanty powerfull enough for the emailing, snapping, internet browsing, calling, messaging, and occasional instagraming i do on it. I also love that i am able to root it and flash a custom rom. As of writing i am using the Noble Candalabra which is a complete port of one ui 6 to the s9 and note 9.</p>
        <p>Now you may have noticed that i had mentioned that i use an iPod and electronic organiser, and nay be wondering what I use them for. Well my school does not allow for the use of mobile phones whilst at the school, so i use the electroinc organiser to add homework i need to do, have my timetable, draft emails, and check the time when i forget my apple watch or amazing seiko sport automatic watch, and the iPod i use for music at school and the occasional watching of mamma mia or the super mario bros super show, or eaven the simpsons episode I totally didn't pirate;)</p>
        <P>i do howver still use two modern devices my apple watch series 6 and my apple ipad mini 5th generation. this is because the apple watch syncs with my outlook calander through a cheep iPhone i leave on my desk to give me my timetable and my emails, which is quite usefull as we use a web app called seqta for our timetables which often has issues, though if the iphone is not constantly on charge the apple watch will fail to sync with outlook making me fall back to the amazing electronic organiser. The iPad i use in class occasionally when i need to go from class to class around the school but need to fill out documents or read somthing or even take photos and draw on them.</P>
