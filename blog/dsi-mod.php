            <p>I just saw this beautiful DSI at my local op shop that had a screen protector installed and was kept in a dsi purse and as I broke my 3DSs charging port. when I brought it home and went to play a game but then realised I had managed to lose all but 1 of my DS games so I decided I needed to mod it</p>
            <h2>modding the console</h2>
            <p>I followed the guide on dsi.hacks.guide opting to use the stilehax method which uses a browser exploit though I found a few issues so I did as follows:</p>
            <p>First you must copy twilight menu, dumpTool, and unlaunch to the root of your SD card</p>
            <p>Then you visit the website stilehax.net on your dsi which should run the exploit. if it does not restart your system by holding the power button and try again</p>
            <p>Once it launches tm++ press start and use the right and left bumpers (R and L) to locate the unsplash configuration and change the background to black</p>
            <p>After exiting the configuration menu launch dump tool and dump your nand to your sd card</p>
            <p>then reboot and redo the exploit to relaunch tm++</p>
            <p>Run the unlaunch installer and select install unlaunch</p>
            <p>After that press and hold the A and B buttons and press the power button once</p>
            <p>After it boots into unlaunch select option, and change the boot preferences. I have no button set to tm++ and a set to launcher</p>
            <p>After this I copied all my game dumps from my 3ds so I can play all my games (you may find other sources for these but I dumped mine)</p>
